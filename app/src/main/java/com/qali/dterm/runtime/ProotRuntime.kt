/**
 * Runs the Termux/Debian runtime under a proot that ships as a NATIVE LIBRARY.
 *
 * Why: from Android 10 (API 29) on, a binary written to the app data dir cannot be
 * execve'd (SELinux `execute_no_trans` on `app_data_file`). That is the wall that
 * kept Termux — and therefore LDFA — off Google Play. The bootstrap's bash/apt and
 * the whole Debian rootfs live in the data dir, so a targetSdk >= 29 build cannot
 * execute them directly.
 *
 * Fix (validated on real hardware, see the PoCs): ship `proot` + its loader + deps
 * as native libraries in `nativeLibraryDir` (which stays executable) and run every
 * data-dir binary THROUGH that proot. proot injects its loader and maps the guest
 * binary itself, sidestepping the execve restriction. proot-distro's own inner
 * proot nests fine as long as both levels share the one native loader.
 *
 * This class is a thin, side-effect-free command transformer. It is GATED: when the
 * proot native libs are absent (e.g. legacy targetSdk-28 builds that still execve
 * from the data dir), [wrap] returns the command unchanged so existing behavior is
 * untouched. Only when the libs are present does it prepend the proot invocation.
